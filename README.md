Problem 1:

We have successfully defined how to identify whether each person is wearing a mask or not.
Social Distancing Monitoring using OpencV ,pyhton and YOLO.
Add yolo-coco folder and models folder as it is a large file you'll have to download it from

Problem 2:

As we have successfully detected human body, we are now initially√Ç  working on the identification of human face without mask, as after continuously working on it we were able to do it.
This code will help you to do social distance detectioni in this COVID-19 situation at your premise. 
You can change the social distance threshold in program to make sure it works best for the your camera/input view. If you want to do more improvisation then you can calculate socail distance threshold dynamicaly based on human objects size so it will be more reliable in case of short and long distance view.
